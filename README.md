# Outbreak READY
This project is in partnership with the [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment](https://www.colorado.gov/cdphe) (CDPHE) and the [Colorado Food Safety Center of Excellence](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/foodsafety/Pages/default.aspx). CDPHE aims to create an interactive, dynamic tool that guides foodborne outbreak investigators through building a tailored outbreak questionnaire. With this tool, investigators will have rapid access to a large, curated database of questionnaire modules, which they can navigate through using a guided, web-based interface to efficiently build a questionnaire that is specific to their outbreak scenario. I will be building a prototype of this tool that CDPHE plans to include in an upcoming grant application to leverage CDC funding to build the full-fledged product.
